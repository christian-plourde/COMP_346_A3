Task 5 is not possible. Since the philosophers are stored in an array and that array has a fixed size, we cannot add philosophers to it mid-execution. It would be possible for a philosopher to leave midway through by having an array of boolean flags say called "present", where if we are executing a method for a philosopher that is not present we just return from it, but to have philosophers join partway through is not possible.
